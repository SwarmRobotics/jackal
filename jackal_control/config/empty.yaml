# The empty Jackal extras configuration has nothing in it and should not.
# It is meant to override the default to add custom control parameters
# file in your own Jackal customization package and setting JACKAL_CONFIG_EXTRAS
# to your customization file in the launch fil control.launch.
# Each parameter will need to be loaded in the correct namespace to
# be used. For example, for a Jackal with a GX5 IMU.
# This can be used to change ekf_localization/imu0 to the topic published
# by the node, e.g. /gx5/data
